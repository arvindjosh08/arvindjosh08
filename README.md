# Hi — I'm Arvind (arvindjosh08) 👋
Test Automation Engineer · Quality Engineering Lead · 15 years in software quality and test automation

I design and build reliable, maintainable automation frameworks and bring quality engineering practices into the CI/CD pipeline. I focus on delivering fast-feedback, low-flakiness test suites and enabling teams to release with confidence.

---

## 🔭 What I do
- Architect and implement test automation frameworks for web, mobile, API, and microservices.
- Drive test strategy, shift-left testing, and continuous testing in CI/CD.
- Mentor and lead engineering teams on test design, test data strategy, and test reliability.
- Reduce test flakiness, shorten feedback loops, and improve observability of test failures.

---

## 🧰 Core Skills & Technologies
- Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Web & UI automation: Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Appium
- Test frameworks: TestNG, JUnit, Pytest, Mocha/Jest
- BDD / ATDD: Cucumber, Gherkin
- API testing: REST, GraphQL, Postman, RestAssured
- CI/CD & orchestration: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker
- Test data & environment: Docker, Docker Compose, Testcontainers, Kubernetes (basic)
- Performance & resilience testing: JMeter, Gatling (experience)
- Observability & reporting: Allure, ExtentReports, ELK integration for logs
- Practices: TDD/BDD, contract testing, flaky test mitigation, test pyramids, test reliability engineering

---

## 🚀 Experience Highlights
- 15 years designing and delivering test and quality engineering solutions across multiple domains.
- Built modular automation frameworks that support parallel execution, cross-browser testing, and CI pipeline integration.
- Led QA teams and mentored engineers in automation best practices, code reviews, and metrics-driven quality improvements.
- Implemented test observability and automated triage to reduce mean time to resolution for flaky or failing tests.

## ⚙️ How I typically work
- Start with requirements and define high-value tests (risk-based testing).
- Build small, maintainable test modules with clear naming, consistent fixtures, and reusable helpers.
- Integrate tests early into pipelines for fast feedback and gated releases.
- Prioritize reliability: isolate flaky tests, add retries judiciously, and improve stability at the root cause.
- Measure and report: test coverage (functional), test execution time, flakiness metrics, and test pass/fail trends.

---

## 🧪 Sample: run tests locally
Example commands (adapt for your projects):
- Install dependencies:
  - Java/Maven: mvn clean test -Dtest=YourTest
  - Node: npm install && npx playwright test
  - Python: pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest
- Run with parallel execution and CI-friendly reporting:
  - mvn -T 4 clean test
  - npx playwright test --reporter=html
  - pytest -n auto --junitxml=report.xml

---

## 📈 Metrics I care about
- Test execution time vs. feedback time
- Flaky test rate and trends
- Test pass rate on CI vs PRs
- Time-to-detect and time-to-fix for failing tests

If you'd like, I can:
- Customize this README with real project links and short project descriptions,
- Create badges for your top repos and CI pipelines,
- Provide a short "Pinned Projects" / "Featured Work" section with sample screenshots or GIFs.

Replace placeholders and pin the repos you want to highlight — I'll help format badges and project summaries next.
